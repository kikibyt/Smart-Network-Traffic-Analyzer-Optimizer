# Smart-Network-Traffic-Analyzer-Optimizer
Smart Network Traffic Analyzer & Optimizer is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and optimize network traffic in real-time. The tool captures, analyzes, and visualizes network data, identifying bottlenecks, congestion, and security threats. It also provides recommendations to improve network performance, making it valuable for network administrators and security professionals.

Features
Real-time packet sniffing for network traffic analysis

Traffic categorization by protocol, source/destination IP, and port

Bandwidth usage tracking and analysis

Top talkers and listeners identification

Alert system for detecting:

Suspicious spikes in traffic

Unauthorized access attempts

Packet loss or delay

Data visualization dashboard showing network traffic trends and performance metrics

Optimization suggestions for improving network performance and security

Future Enhancements
In the future, the Smart Network Traffic Analyzer & Optimizer will include the following features:

Integration with SNMP to collect data from routers and switches

Email/SMS alerts for high-severity anomalies

Latency, packet loss, throughput, jitter, network utilization, and error rates calculations

Improved machine learning-based anomaly detection for smarter alerts and recommendations

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-network-traffic-analyzer.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd smart-network-traffic-analyzer
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To analyze real-time network traffic, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python smart_network_traffic_analyzer.py <interface_name> <port_scan_threshold>
Replace <interface_name> with your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0, etc.).

Replace <port_scan_threshold> with the desired threshold for detecting potential port scanning activities (e.g., 100 for high traffic).
