# Smart Network Traffic Analyzer & Optimizer

**Smart Network Traffic Analyzer & Optimizer** is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and optimize network traffic in real-time. The tool captures, analyzes, and visualizes network data, identifying bottlenecks, congestion, and security threats. It also provides recommendations to improve network performance, making it valuable for network administrators and security professionals.

## Features

- **Real-time packet sniffing** for network traffic analysis
- **Traffic categorization** by protocol, source/destination IP, and port
- **Bandwidth usage** tracking and analysis
- **Top talkers and listeners** identification
- **Alert system** for detecting:
  - Suspicious spikes in traffic
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Packet loss or delay
- **Data visualization dashboard** showing network traffic trends and performance metrics
- **Optimization suggestions** for improving network performance and security

## Future Enhancements

In the future, the Smart Network Traffic Analyzer & Optimizer will include the following features:

- Integration with **SNMP** to collect data from routers and switches
- **Email/SMS alerts** for high-severity anomalies
- **Latency, packet loss, throughput, jitter**, network utilization, and error rates calculations
- Improved **machine learning-based anomaly detection** for smarter alerts and recommendations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-network-traffic-analyzer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd smart-network-traffic-analyzer
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To analyze real-time network traffic, run the following command:

```bash
python smart_network_traffic_analyzer.py <interface_name> <port_scan_threshold>
```

- Replace `<interface_name>` with your network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0, etc.).
- Replace `<port_scan_threshold>` with the desired threshold for detecting potential port scanning activities (e.g., 100 for high traffic).
